I am coming from the political science field, which I studied at the University of Konstanz – however, I shifted a bit towards statistics and computer science. Currently, my work includes small area estimation, (spatial) data integration, and the like. I enjoy learning more on how to implement the notion of reproducible, robust research infrastructure. In particular, I am eager to dive deeper into database engineering and the design of data systems.\nA friend of mine (who has a nice blog running) has repeatedly encouraged me to get started with blogging about technical topics, so I finally will give it a try 😬. Thus, I hope that over time some interesting posts will come into existence to justify the presence of this website!\nReading list\nIn my spare time, I am currently trying to read some bits of the following books (with scientific/technical content), and I’d be open about any form of exchange:\nGottschling, Peter. 2019. Forschung mit modernem C++\nHodges, James S. 2013. Richly Parameterized Linear Models\nKleppmann, Martin. 2017. Designing Data-intensive Applications\nMcElreath, Richard. 2020. Statistical Rethinking\nNoback, Matthias. 2020. Object Design Style Guide\nRao, J.N.K. and Isabel Molina. 2015. Small Area Estimation\n\n\n\n",
